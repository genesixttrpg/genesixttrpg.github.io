# GeneSix

GeneSix is a love letter to _Genesys™_, created by Sam Gregor-Stewart and a team of talented designers at Fantasy Flight Games.  The goal of GeneSix is to create a system that leverages the many boons of OSR/NSR systems such as Soulmuppet Publishing's _Orbital Blues™_ that flourish now in the TTRPG space and to harness the narrative might of the _Genesys™_ system, while addressing a number of shortcomings observed through a decade of conversation and play among the _Genesys_ communities and various OSR/NSR titles.
