GeneSix is a love letter to _Genesys_, created by Sam Gregor-Stewart and a team of talented designers at Fantasy Flight Games.  The goal of GeneSix is to create a system that leverages the many boons of OSR systems such as Soulmuppet Publishing's _Orbital Blues_ that flourish now in the TTRPG space and to harness the narrative might of the _Genesys_ system, while addressing a number of shortcomings observed through a decade of conversation and play among the _Genesys_ communities and various OSR titles.
