# Encounters

Encounters in opposition follow an identical structure, although timing can be flexible depending on the circumstances. Violent encounters and nonviolent encounters share many aspects regarding rounds and turns, with a turn being defined as what a character may do in 5-10 seconds, and a round being defined as a complete set of turns by all characters in the encounter.  While action happens more or less simultaneously narratively, the precision timing aids in building an interesting story.

## The Action Economy

Characters have the ability to perform one major action, one minor action, and a small number of incidental actions as the circumstances warrant

Major Actions - actions that take 5+ seconds

- Perform a check
- Move to a far range band

Minor Actions - actions that take 2-3 seconds

- manipulate carried gear
- move between close and near range bands
- reload a weapon
- aim a weapon

Incidental Actions - actions that take only a second or two, and can be concurrent with major and minor actions

- make a clever quip
- communicate with characters within range
- pick up or drop an item

## Initiative

Encounters mandate a structured order to events - while they generally happen mere seconds apart, the order in which they happen is important.  Characters will make an initiative check based on the Attribute plus the Approach they're using when they enter the encounter against a Target Difficulty of  7 (Average) - although this can be modified by Environmental circumstances, Advantageous/Disadvantageous circumstances, and even Advantage or Disadvantage.

Using the Delta of the check results, the order of action starts at the highest and ends at the lowest.  Initiative order is pooled in two groups - player characters and NPCs.  Thus, pcs need not act on the initiative slot they individually yielded, and neither do NPCs.  Characters may only act once per round, regardless of their initiative slot, unless incapacitated.

### Changing Initiative Mid-Encounter

Situations occur that suggest the initiative order can change mid-encounter.  A character's check that results in a significant advantageous or scene altering circumstance can specify that the tables have turned, and an initiative recheck will happen before the next round begins.

### Circumstances as Applied to Initiative

If a character's check results in an advantageous, disadvantageous, or significantly either, these effects can be declared before the next round begins.  This also applies to  a scene altering circumstance.

## Nonviolent Encounters

Often problems can be solved without resorting to fisticuffs or firing shots.  A well-placed remark can turn a foe away just as effectively as bloodshed.
When entering a nonviolent encounter, all involved parties make an initiative check, then the encounter proceeds in a loosely structured manner as specific timing isn't always necessary.  However, keeping track of time is useful if there is a time limit to accomplish the goals of the encounter.

### Nonviolent Encounter Initiative

This is usually based off Mental or Social.  The character had the wherewithal to bring their wits with them.

## Violent Encounters

Sometimes the solution to a problem involves violence.  Sometimes a well-placed remark can lead to wounded pride, embarrassment, and drawn weapons.  
When entering a violent encounter, all parties involved make an initiative check, then the encounter proceeds in a structured manner due to the rapid pace of violent encounters.  

### Violent Encounter Initiative

This is usually based off Agility or Mental.  The character had the physical or mental aptitude to act.

#### Surprise!

If a character or group of characters wish to ambush another group, they must be both prepared and successfully make an opposed check using a Covertly approach against the opposition using the Cautiously approach.  These checks can be group checks on both sides.  

## Range

Range is determined in graduated steps from one object to another.  Conversational distance is a good guideline for determining range

- Close  - the characters can hear each other whisper
- Near - Characters can have a conversation without raising their voices
- Far - characters need to shout to communicate verbally
- Distant - Conversation cannot be had at this distance, but yelling can be heard

Beyond the Distant range, nonverbal communication might be possible but generally, it's not available unless there are circumstances that allow it (flags, signal lights, flares.)

## Movement Within Encounters

Moving within close range is an incidental.  Moving from close to Near range is a minor action.  Moving to far range is a major action.  Moving beyond far range cannot be done in a single turn.
