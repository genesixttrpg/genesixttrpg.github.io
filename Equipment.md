## Equipment

Equipment has tags that denote special qualities that items possess; this applies to all equipment including weapons and armor, although common sense is the litmus test for applying tags.  

- Ongoing - the item's effect continues over multiple turns
- Armor piercing - the item's effect ignores a degree of Toughness
- Ensnaring - the item's effect prevents the affected target from moving from close range with the item
- Stunning - the item's effect prevents the affected target from moving further than near range and limits the affected target to minor and incidental actions
- Immobilizing - the item's effect prevents the affected target from moving at all
- Superior - the item grants Advantage to checks made using it
- Inferior - the item imposes Disadvantage to checks made using it
- Automatic - the item's effect can be applied to a target multiple times, or to multiple targets within close range of the initial target
- Explosive - the item's effect can affect multiple targets within close range of the

### Gear Encumbrance

Characters can care a gear up to their Encumbrance attribute.  Gear is ranked in increments, which have an equivalent cost for Encumbrance.  Encumbrance is an abstraction os both mass and volume.  A large, empty crate might have the same Encumbrance value as a sack of uranium doorknobs.  

Gear Encumbrance Values

| Size  |Value|Example                                 |
|:------|:---:|:---------------------------------------|
|Tiny   |  0  | a book of matches, a ring              |
|Small  | .5  | a cellphone, a pocket knife            |
|Medium |  1  | a pistol, a book, a hand tool          |
|Large  |  2  | a two-handed weapon, a loaded backpack |
|Huge   |  4  | a large crate                          |

The GM is encouraged to modify Encumbrance values for items as fits the story.

### Money

Rare is the player that sits down to play a roleplaying game intent to manage spreadsheets and budgets and bean counting.  While there is a place for this type of play, that is not in the spirit of GeneSix.  

Money is ranked like Attributes and Approaches, from -2 to +2, with 0 being the average for starting characters.  When players wish to acquire gear that is deemed mundane, it occurs at the appropriate time at the GM's discretion.  For items deemed to be extraordinary, a check is required.  A GM will establish a Target Number based on the difficulty of acquiring said item, and the character can make a check - usually Social - modified by the Money attribute
